<p>For the second Arcton Coding Extravaganza we trailed a longer form event running across almost an entire week - this produced a host of different challenges around balancing with jobs, time planning and managing burnout. As with last year each entrant had to code up comething to match their personal theme as well as a central theme chosen before the event begun. To celebrate the bringing in of the new spring season the central theme for this event was "New".</p>

<h2 class="ace-heading">Grady Hooker ("Augmentation")</h2>
<p>'ProcrastiChicken Farming' is a new take on an idle game, embedded into your browser as a chrome extension. As you browse certain websites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube you have a chance to encounter an egg that will be added to your chicken coop and as you spend more time with that website as your active tab the egg will hatch and begin to level up. The intention is to gamify the monitoring of website usage and add a little bit of fun to browsing social websites and websites from specific countries.</p>

<h2 class="ace-heading">Adam Fleming ("Bamboozle")</h2>
<p><a href="https://arcton.nz/bamboozle/">'Shattr' <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is Adam's project that takes an image and shatters it with the help of shatter.js before leaving the user to try and find the magic spot to repair the image. There are many different mathematical effects that have been applied as the user moves their mouse around and many more that could be experimented with by merely changing a couple of values. The aim of the game is to find the spot on the canvas and put your mouse on top to recreate the image enough to correctly guess what the image is of.</p>

<h2 class="ace-heading">Jeremy Symon ("Rhythm")</h2>
<p>Jeremy implemented a smorgasbord of technological tidbits revolving around his themes. The first of which attempted to programmatically generate music by emulating the sounds that real-life instruments made using pure math. Although the music didn't sound the best to the human ear, the spectrograms were a piece of art. The second was another advancement on his project from the last ACE with the addition of a UI constraints and key binding configuration system designed to support a simple rhythm game.</p>

<h2 class="ace-heading">Nathaniel Watson ("The Box")</h2>
<p>Nathaniel conceptualized a new way of viewing recipes for the modern chief, utilizing a tree-like visualization such as the one used by GitHub and other source control websites. It would show you the ingredients you have to add as new branches, and then as they would merge in they would indicate the method used to mix said ingredients. This allows...</p>
