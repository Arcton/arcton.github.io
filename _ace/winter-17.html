<p>Over Queen's Birthday weekend the first Sixty-Four Hour Arcton Coding Extravaganza commenced. Each entrant had 64 hours to code up something to match their themes - The central theme for the weekend was "Chaos" and each participant also had a randomly selected second theme they had to incorporate into their work.</p>
<h2 class="ace-heading">Nathaniel Watson ("Fantasy")</h2>
<p><a href="https://nathanielw.github.io/otter-chaos/">'Complete and Otter Chaos in a World of Fanta Seas' <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> - Did you know otters love to drink Fanta? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyyBx6-VMQg">It's true</a>. But in a world where the oceans are made of the sweet orange beverage, the otters' addiction is taking a devastating toll on both the environment and the world's soft drink supply. It's you're job to fend off increasingly challenging waves of the creatures before they completely drink the fanta-seas dry.</p>

<h2 class="ace-heading">Adam Fleming ("Evolution")</h2>
<p>'Scrap Up' - In a chaotic world of rampaging robots, you have decided to reclaim the land for the humans. Starting by using the most basic robot parts you could find, your goal is to salvage parts from defeated bots to evolve your own machine. Destroyed bots drop a random part which will be placed into your inventory when collected. Each part has properties and effects that change how your bot will work. Constantly evolve your bot to get the advantage.

<h2 class="ace-heading">Grady Hooker ("Nostalgia")</h2>
<p><a href="http://grady.nz/64h-ace/">'Windows Nine-T-8' <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> emulates the Windows 98 user interface within a simulated CRT monitor in a room decorated with game posters and wallpaper straight out of the 1990's. Within the operating system you can read a text file about Chaos and some other gods, listen to some Chaos-themed music, check some emails, launch the classic video game DOOM or trigger a "virus". This virus repeatedly pops up ads from the 1990's on the screen and if you don't close them fast enough you will treated with the classic Windows blue screen of death.</p>

<h2 class="ace-heading">Jeremy Symon ("Colossus")</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jtsymon/shadow/">'Shadows' <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> is a basic game engine that Jeremy began work on 3 years ago. Built in C++ and OpenGL it utilises a top down 2D viewport, but uses the player as a pseudo-light source to shadow everything they can't see as a fog of war.  During the extravaganza Jeremy enhanced the rendering of the engine by optimising the color scheme and allowing the casted shadows to show the walls rather than directly render them to the screen.</p>
