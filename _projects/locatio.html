<p>Locatio is a free browser extension to enhance online property listings. When hunting for a house, finding out about a neighbourhood often relies on word-of-mouth and local knowledge that is hard to access or simply inaccurate.</p>
<p>We augment listings on TradeMe with hyper-local data that gives you critical information at a glance, saving time and letting you make a more informed decision. The data is sourced from a wide range of locations, including the New Zealand Census and NZ Police crime statistics, letting you choose a home with peace of mind.</p>
