<p>NautDrafter is an application created for players of the online battle game Awesomenauts, designed to give competitive teams a means through which to select their characters before a battle. The team began building the application in July 2014 for Monky Games, as part of a third-year software engineering paper.</p>
<p>NautDrafter has been used in various Awesomenauts competitive tournaments including the Alienware Awesome Cup and the Awesomenauts Australian League. During these tournaments we had to handle a large influx of user feedback and communicate with the Awesomenauts community directly through their forums and Steam page.</p>
<p>The application is built with Java, utilizing JavaFX for the UI and official Ronimo Games (creators of Awesomenauts) graphical and audio assets (used with permission). In addition to being responsible for writing the application we also managed the development process, for which we followed a Scrum-based methodology.</p>
